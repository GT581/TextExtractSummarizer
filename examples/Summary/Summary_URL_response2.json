  "summary": "The domestic cat ( *Felis catus*) is a small, domesticated carnivorous mammal, the only domesticated species in the Felidae family.  Archaeological and genetic evidence points to its domestication in the Near East around 7500 BC, likely drawn to early human settlements by rodents. While commonly kept as pets or farm cats, they also exist as feral cats, avoiding human contact.  Humans value cats for companionship and their vermin-killing abilities.\n\nCats possess physical adaptations for hunting, including retractable claws, a flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and well-developed night vision and sense of smell.  They are solitary hunters and crepuscular predators, exhibiting intelligence through adaptability, observational learning, and problem-solving skills.  Their communication involves vocalizations (meowing, purring, hissing, etc.) and body language, and they possess a heightened sense of hearing and smell, including the ability to detect pheromones and ultrasonic sounds.  Female cats (queens) can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and year-round in equatorial regions, with litter sizes typically ranging from two to five.\n\nThe domestic cat's scientific classification has been debated, with the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ultimately recognizing it as a distinct species, *Felis catus*, likely descended from the African wildcat (*F. lybica*).  While undergoing minor anatomical and behavioral changes during domestication, cats retain the ability to survive in the wild.  Selective breeding has led to the development of numerous cat breeds, but purebred populations exhibit reduced genetic diversity and increased susceptibility to genetic disorders.\n\nCats' physical characteristics include a smaller skull and shorter bones than their wild ancestors.  Their unique skeletal structure, particularly the extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae, contributes to their spinal flexibility and agility.  Their specialized dentition is adapted for consuming small prey, and their protractible claws are crucial for hunting and climbing.  Their digitigrade locomotion allows for silent movement and efficient hunting.  Cats' remarkable balance and the \"cat righting reflex\" allow them to land on their feet during falls.  Their coat colors and patterns are determined by genetic factors.\n\nCats possess highly developed senses. Their excellent night vision is enhanced by the tapetum lucidum, while their hearing surpasses that of humans in both range and sensitivity.  Their sense of smell is acute, allowing them to detect pheromones and certain plant compounds like nepetalactone (catnip).  Interestingly, cats lack the ability to taste sweetness due to a genetic mutation.\n\nTheir behavior is influenced by both genetics and environment.  While generally solitary hunters, they can exhibit social behavior, particularly in feral colonies.  Their communication involves a range of vocalizations and body language cues.  Cats engage in play, often mimicking hunting behaviors, and their hunting strategies vary depending on prey availability.  Domestic cats are significant predators of wildlife, impacting bird and mammal populations globally.\n\nCats' reproductive cycle involves polyestrous females and competitive mating among males.  Gestation lasts around 65 days, resulting in litters of one to six kittens.  Kittens are weaned at six to seven weeks and reach sexual maturity at five to ten months.  Spaying and neutering are common practices to control population growth and mitigate undesirable behaviors.  The average lifespan of pet cats has increased significantly in recent decades, with neutering contributing to increased longevity.  Cats are susceptible to various diseases, but vaccinations and treatments are available for many.  Their global distribution is widespread, with varying levels of popularity as pets across different regions.  Cats have a rich history and cultural significance, featuring prominently in mythology and folklore across numerous cultures.  Their impact on human society extends beyond companionship, encompassing pest control, the fur trade (now largely outlawed), and even superstitious practices.",
